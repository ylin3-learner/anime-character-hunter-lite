# 🕵️ Anime Character Hunter Lite

**[English](README.md) | [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)**

An interactive, cognitive-pipeline-driven English grammar learning tool designed for K-12 education.

Built with **Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, and Supabase**, this application takes a pedagogical approach to teaching **Post-modifiers (Relative Clauses & Prepositional Phrases)**, specifically targeting the common L1 interference (Chinese pre-modifiers vs. English post-modifiers), structural misconceptions (e.g., redundant pronouns like `who she`), and **Phrase Chunking**.

It is designed around a single 45-minute lesson for **Grade 9 (115 iE5, Unit 5: *The Man Who Shook Hands with Me Is My Favorite Star*)**, covering Grammar Focus 1 (prepositional phrases), Grammar Focus 2 (subject relative clauses with *who / which / that*), and the p.107 Read activity.

## 🧠 The Cognitive Pipeline (Pedagogy-Driven Design)

This app is built upon Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theories and features **three distinct question types**, guiding students through a specific cognitive loop:

    Start((Start)) --> Preview
    
    subgraph Presentation ["1. Input & Scaffolding"]
        Preview["🔍 Chunk Preview<br>Form-Meaning Mapping"]
        Input["🎧 Structured Input<br>Listening Comprehension"]
        Preview --> Input
    end

        Noticing["💡 Noticing Board<br>Self-Correction"]
        Output --> Noticing
    end

    Noticing --> End((Finish))

    %% Behaviorism & Classroom Management
    Focus["⚠️ Anti-Cheat Beep"] -.-> Practice
    Timer["⏱️ Time Pressure"] -.-> Practice
    Data["📊 Error Tracking"] -.-> Teacher((Teacher Dashboard))
    Micro -.-> Data

    subgraph ClassroomMgmt ["🎓 Classroom Management (New)"]
        ClassMode["🔒 Class Mode<br>Lock student progression"]
        Presence["📊 Presence Tracking<br>Live completed count"]
        SelfPace["🟢 Self-Paced Mode<br>Free progression"]
    end

    ClassMode -.-> Practice
    Presence -.-> Teacher
    SelfPace -.-> Practice
```

1. **Chunk Phrase Quiz**: Establishes Form-Meaning Mapping.
2. **Macro Drag & Contrast Puzzle**: Builds a spatial sense of English post-modification (no text labels to prevent answer leaking).
3. **Standard & Reduce**: Features Input Processing, Focus on Form using a unique **"Trash Can" subtraction mechanic**, Prosody Output, and Consciousness-Raising.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is highly decoupled, using **Supabase** as the central hub to connect the Vue 3 frontend, teacher admin, and external AI speech services.

        end
    end

    subgraph ThirdParty ["Third-Party API"]
        Deepgram["Deepgram API"]
    end

## 🎙️ Hybrid Speech Architecture

To ensure 100% stability across all devices (iPads, computers, and smart whiteboards with no system voice packs), this app implements a robust **fallback mechanism**.

- **TTS**: Detects native voices. If none, routes to **Deepgram TTS** via Supabase Edge Function.
- **STT**: Bypasses browser restrictions by sending audio to **Deepgram STT** via Supabase Edge Function.

## ⚡ Real-time Classroom Flow (Master-Slave & Anti-Cheat)

This sequence diagram illustrates the **Class Mode Lock**, **Presence Tracking**, and **Anti-Cheat** mechanisms.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as 👩‍🏫 Teacher
    participant EF as 🛡️ Edge Function
    participant RT as 📡 Realtime (Presence & DB)
    participant S as 👨‍🎓 Student A
    participant S2 as 👨‍🎓 Student B

    Note over T,RT: Scenario 1: Teacher enables "Class Mode" (Target: 30)
    
    T->>EF: Enable Class Mode & Set Target
    EF->>RT: Update classroom_state (is_class_mode = true)
    RT-->>S: Sync State (isClassMode = true)
    RT-->>S2: Sync State (isClassMode = true)

    Note over S,RT: Scenario 2: Student Answers & Presence Tracking
    
    S->>S: Complete Question (handleSuccess)
    S->>RT: track({ status: 'completed' })
    RT-->>T: Presence Sync (Update Completed Count: 1)
    
    Note over S,T: Scenario 3: Class Mode Lock
    
    S->>S: Click "Next Question"
    S-->>S: Button Disabled (Wait for Teacher)
    
    T->>EF: Click "🚀 Push to Class"
    EF->>RT: Update Question ID
    RT-->>S: Question switches, track({ status: 'answering' })
    RT-->>S2: Question switches, track({ status: 'answering' })
    
    Note over S, Browser: Anti-Cheat: If tab is hidden, Beep + Red Overlay.

## ✨ Key Features

### For Students
- **Trash Can Subtraction UI (Reduce Mode)**: Students see the complete sentence and physically discard redundant words into a trash can, witnessing the sentence shrink.
- **Class Mode Lock**: When the teacher enables Class Mode, the "Next" button is disabled. Students must wait for the teacher's push command.
- **Phrase Chunking Visuals**: Multi-word units appear as distinct blue tiles.
- **Randomized Audio**: TTS randomly selects from a pool of voices.
- **Text-Diff Pronunciation Panel**: Record your voice via Deepgram STT.

### For Teachers (Teacher Admin)
- **Presence Dashboard**: Input the target student count. Watch the live progress bar (`completed / target`) update in real-time as students finish.
- **Class Mode Toggle**: Lock the entire class's progression instantly. Perfect for synchronized classroom teaching.
- **Funnel-Based Authoring**: Wrap phrases in `[ ]`. Visualizes "Kept" and "Discarded" words. If a verb needs to become a preposition, edit the green box.
- **Master Remote Control**: Push questions, force-reset timers, and add time (`+30s`) instantly.

## 🔬 Diagnostic Rule Engine

| Code | Triggered when | What it tells the teacher |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DUPLICATE_PRONOUN` | A subject pronoun follows *who / which / that*. | The student doesn't see the relative pronoun replaces the noun. |
| `SV_AGREEMENT` | The verb disagrees with the antecedent's number. | The student hasn't mastered verb agreement. |
| `WRONG_RELATIVE` | *who* for a thing, or *which* for a person. | The student can't choose the pronoun by antecedent type. |
| `NOT_REDUCED` | In a **reduce** question, the relative pronoun is still present. | The student didn't apply the conversion. |
| `INCOMPLETE_REDUCTION` | The pronoun is gone but a *be* verb is left. | The student removed the pronoun but not the *be* verb. |
| `WRONG_ORDER` | Grammar is fine but tile order differs. | Word order is off. |
| `PUZZLE_ERROR` | Puzzle piece misses the target slot. | Lacks spatial sense of post-modification. |
